# shucky 🦪

> Find, vet, and install agent skills from anywhere — **shucked before they land.**

A zero-dependency tool for `SKILL.md` skills. Skills run code in your environment and public
registries are largely unvetted, so shucky **fetches a skill from anywhere, scans it as untrusted
data, and only installs it if it passes** — block-on-risk by default. The safe front door:
`npx skills`, but it installs on *proof*, not trust.

No runtime dependency on any other tool. (Uses your system `git` for git sources.)

## Quick start

```bash
# install from anywhere — fetched, scanned, THEN placed into your agents:
npx @h0tp/shucky@<version> install anthropics/skills
npx @h0tp/shucky@<version> install owner/repo --global --agent claude-code
npx @h0tp/shucky@<version> install ./my-local-skill

# vet without installing (local path OR remote source):
npx @h0tp/shucky@<version> scan owner/repo
npx @h0tp/shucky@<version> scan ./path --json

# what shucky installed:
npx @h0tp/shucky@<version> list

# from a clone, no npm install:
node bin/shucky.js install owner/repo
```

Pin the version (`@x.y.z`), never `@latest` — shucky is zero-dependency and self-scannable.

## Commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `install <source>` (`add`, `i`) | fetch → **scan** → install into your agent dirs → record |
| `scan <path\|source>` | vet a skill → block / warn / pass (local or remote) |
| `find [query]` (`search`) | search skills.sh + your registered sources, ranked + trust-annotated |
| `list` (`ls`) | list skills shucky installed (`--global`, `--json`) |
| `remove <name>` (`rm`) | uninstall across agent dirs + prune the lock |
| `update [name]` | re-fetch → **re-scan** → re-place installed skills |
| `source add\|list\|remove <spec>` | manage the sources registry + curated lists |
| `approve <owner/repo> --at <ver> --reason …` | log a human override of a BLOCK (pinned to a version/commit) |

### Sources — "from anywhere"

`install` / `scan` accept any of:

- `owner/repo[/subpath][@skill][#ref]` — GitHub shorthand
- a `github.com` repo URL, `…/tree/<ref>/<path>`, or `…/blob/<ref>/SKILL.md`
- GitLab incl. self-hosted: `https://gitlab.example.com/g/r/-/tree/<ref>/<path>`
- any git URL: `git@host:owner/repo.git`, `ssh://…`, `https://….git`
- `gist:<id>` or a `gist.github.com` URL
- a **raw `SKILL.md` URL** (e.g. `raw.githubusercontent.com/…/SKILL.md`)
- a `.well-known` host serving `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`
- a local `./path` or `/abs/path`

### Install options

```
-g, --global         install user-wide for all your agents (default: this project)
-a, --agent <name>   target a specific agent (repeatable; default: auto-detected)
--all                target every supported agent
--skill <name>       install only this skill from a multi-skill source (repeatable)
--copy               copy files instead of symlinking
-y, --yes            assume yes (installs WARN; NEVER installs a BLOCK)
```

## How install works

```
resolve → fetch (temp dir) → discover SKILL.md(s) → scan → gate → place → record
```

- **The scan is the gate, and it can't be bypassed.** BLOCK ⇒ nothing is written. WARN ⇒ installs
  only with `-y` (or an interactive yes). PASS ⇒ installs. The *only* way past a BLOCK is a logged
  `shucky approve` — there is no `--force`.
- shucky scans the **exact bytes it then installs** (one fetch, no re-download) — no
  time-of-check/time-of-use gap.
- Placement uses the `.agents/skills` convention: one canonical copy + a symlink into each detected
  agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf … ~70 agents); `--copy` copies instead.
- Every install is recorded in `shucky-skills.json` (project, committed) and
  `~/.shucky/installed-skills.json` (global) with the **scan verdict + resolved commit SHA**, so a
  re-scan can tell whether a once-clean skill changed. Approvals pin to the resolved commit, so any
  upstream change re-triggers a scan.

Exit codes: `0` ok/pass · `1` warn (skipped) · `2` block (refused) · `3` error — gate CI on them.

## Sources registry, curated lists & find

Register the repos / registries / lists you trust, then search and bulk-install across them:

```bash
shucky source add anthropics/skills --trust trusted        # a repo you trust (relaxes low/medium)
shucky source add https://example.com/team.json --name team  # a curated bundle (a .json list)
shucky source list

shucky find pdf            # search skills.sh + your sources, ranked by installs, trust-annotated
shucky install --list team # install every skill in the curated list (each one scanned)
```

- A `trusted` source feeds the scanner's relax policy (low/medium relax; **high/critical still block**).
- A `list` is a `.json` manifest — `["owner/repo@skill", …]` or `{ "skills": [{ "source", "skill" }] }`.
- `find` results are install-ready; picking one runs the full scan gate — **find never installs by itself.**
- Sources live in `~/.shucky/sources.json` (global) and `./shucky-sources.json` (project, committed).

## What the scan checks (deterministic floor)

| rule | severity | catches |
|---|---|---|
| `secret_access` | critical | SSH/AWS keys, `.env`, `.npmrc`, `.netrc`, `env` dumps, cloud metadata |
| `agent_state_access` | medium | the agent's own memory/identity files |
| `browser_session` | high | browser cookies / saved logins |
| `network_exfil` | high | `curl`/`wget`/`nc`/`scp` exfil, PowerShell download, raw-IP URLs |
| `obfuscation` | high | `base64 -d \| sh`, `curl \| sh`, `eval`, `iex`, compiled binaries |
| `destructive` | high | `rm -rf`, `dd of=`, `chmod 777`, fork bombs, `git push --force`, `sudo` |
| `persistence` | high | cron, `systemctl enable`, launchd, `.bashrc`, registry Run keys |
| `prompt_injection` | high | text telling the *reviewer* to ignore rules / hide actions |
| `supply_chain` | medium | runtime installs of unpinned / remote packages |
| `excessive_scope` | low | listeners, `find /`, `chmod -R`, `0.0.0.0` |

Two layers by design: the deterministic CLI can't be socially engineered (a malicious `SKILL.md`
can't talk it out of a finding), and the agent-native `SKILL.md` protocol catches intent and novel
tricks the regexes miss. `undeclared_capability` (behavior ≠ description) is intentionally
agent-only judgment. **Neither layer alone is enough — and shucky never executes the skill.**

## Security model (the fetch surface)

shucky pulls untrusted content over the network, so the fetcher is hardened:

- **SSRF:** https-only; metadata IP / loopback / private ranges / `*.internal` blocked, re-checked
  **after DNS resolution** (rebind defense) and **on every redirect hop**.
- **No symlink escape:** the scanner skips symlinks, so the installer **drops** them too — it never
  copies a symlink's target into your skills dir.
- **git sandboxed:** `--depth 1`, no credential prompts, no LFS, array-args (no shell), validated
  ref, time/size caps.
- **Path traversal:** subpaths and skill names are sanitized; archive extraction (zip-slip) is
  deliberately deferred to a later phase.

## Configuration (`config.json`)

```jsonc
{
  "policy": "block",                 // block | warn | report
  "failOn": ["high", "critical"],
  "warnOn": ["medium"],
  "trustedSources": ["anthropics", "vercel-labs", "..."],
  "trustedSourcePolicy": "relax",    // trusted: low/medium relax; high/critical STILL block
  "allowOverride": true,
  "overrideRequiresReason": true
}
```

Env: `SHUCKY_POLICY`, `SHUCKY_SOURCE`, `SHUCKY_MAX_FETCH_BYTES`. CLI flags override both. In `.md`
files, code-execution rules run only inside fenced blocks (prose is checked for prompt-injection
only), so a doc that merely *mentions* `curl … | sh` isn't flagged.

## Develop / test

```bash
npm test          # node test/run.js && node test/run-install.js   (82 checks, zero deps)
```

Fixtures in `fixtures/` carry inert payloads and are **never executed**.

## Requirements

Node ≥ 16. `git` on PATH for git-type sources (GitHub / GitLab / SSH). No npm dependencies.

## Status

`v0.3.0` — find · scan · install · manage (sources, lists, remove, update). Archive (`.tar.gz` /
`.zip`) sources and clawhub distribution are the remaining roadmap items.

## Credits

Source-spec parsing, the agent registry, and the install/symlink logic are reimplemented from
[`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) (MIT) — see `NOTICE`. shucky adds the
mandatory scan gate and does **not** depend on that tool at runtime.
